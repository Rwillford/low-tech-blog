## My Story
My biggest problem was that I sat down and coded this all out with testing it as I went. I have been able to resolve most of my issues I was running into, mostly spelling errors.<br>
You can sign up, log in and sign out. you can type in your post but it won't post the post. There must be something wrong in that area of my code and I haven't been able to figure it out. While typing up this readme my heroku won't take up my lastest version of my code and now im getting a internal server error when you click on the link, i only changed testarea to textarea on the commit that broke it. I swear the link was working before now i can't even submit a screenshot of it working. Im just going to crawl in a corner and cry. I hate having to submit this assignment so broken but I have to move on.
